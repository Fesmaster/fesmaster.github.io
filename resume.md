### Education
Currently, I am studying in University, with an expected graduation date of August 2022, with a BS is Applied Computer Science.
This education has given me a great deal of experience with many aspects of Computer Science, from high-level scripting to Assembly and Operating System code. 

I helped some classmates with one of their published projects, [Shepard of Light](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1106770/Shepherd_of_Light/), performing a number of Tech-support tasks, including tracking down and repairing issues in git repositories. 
Some of my other University projects are located under the [Portfolio](portfolio.html) page.

Outside of University, I have worked on a number of projects, mostly making tools for myself. These have included VR sandboxes, dungeon generations systems, and terminal-based utilities.

### Experience and Work

I have worked since June of 2021 as an online instructor for [IDTech](https://www.idtech.com/), where I have taught a number of middle- and high-schoolers, covering both basics and more advanced subjects in Programming and Game Design.

As of August 2021, my main focus is [Tara Game Engine](https://github.com/Tara-Engine/Tara), a massive project to build a fully-featured 3D game engine designed from the ground up for procedural games.
