Hello, I am Stephen Kelly, and as visible through my site, I am a game engine and graphics programmer. I graduate this summer (2022) with a BS in Applied Computer Science, with a focus on Game Programming, though my personal favorite areas are the underlying engine and procedural generation. Combining these lead to the development of my personal project, the Tara game engine, which consumes a good chunk of my free time. I also enjoy teaching CS, as passing on knowledge is important to me, and I find that teaching something is one of the best ways to learn it.

Outside of the Game and CS world, I love stories, from the mastery of J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and Frank Herbert, to old classics like Beowulf and Dante's Divine Comedy. I have been running a D&D Campaign for over two years straight, which is both a storytelling challenge and great fun! For hobbies I enjoy hiking and blacksmithing, both being excellent things further from a screen.

#### Favorite Games:
- the aforementioned D&D
- Portal and Portal 2
- Kerbal Space Program
- [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/), which got me into Game Development in the first place
- Horizon Zero Dawn

#### Favorite Books:
- *The Lord of the Rings* by J. R. R. Tolkien
- *Dune* by Frank Herbert
- C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy (*Out of the Silent Planet*, *Perelandra*, and *That Hideous Strength*)
