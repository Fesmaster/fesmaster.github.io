## Welcome

Hello, I am Stephen Kelly, a computer scientist who specializes in Game and Game Engine architecture, as well as Computer Graphics. I have a deep love of these areas, and often work on projects related to them for fun. In spare time, I often work on my Game Engine, Tara, as well as other small game-related projects. In my work, I always strive to write human-understandable code, a skill that becomes more and more relevant as I spend more time writing APIs then using them. Check out my [Portfolio](portfolio.md) for past and current projects!
