## Educational Projects

A number of small web games made for class are available [right here](https://fesmaster.github.io/CS325/) on my website. These were week-long challenges, though they usually have a decent amount of polish, built in JavaScript. 
Particularly good ones include [Alchemy](https://fesmaster.github.io/CS325/alchemy/), [Don't Solve the Maze](https://fesmaster.github.io/CS325/maze_trap/), and [Key Finder (V2)](https://fesmaster.github.io/CS325/key_finder_v2/).

## Tara
[Tara](https://github.com/Tara-Engine/Tara) is a Game Engine I have been developing starting August 2021. I can't really say anything to its current state here, as it will undoubtedly be outdated by the end of the week, so the best way is to go check it out on github, and look at the various branches and commit history, or, build it yourself. Tara is designed to be used to make procedural games, in the vein of Minecraft, No Man's Sky, Terraria, or 7 Days to Die. It came to my attention that most games like this, with their high amounts of Runtime-Generated content and highly dynamic worlds either have their own custom engines or they use heavily retooled existing engines. There are no engines I found that specialize in dynamic, procedural gameplay. That is the goal of Tara, to provide this missing tool. While it is currently highly in-development, it is a good showcase of skill.
